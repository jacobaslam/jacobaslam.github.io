## Favorite Labs from CPSC 120 L

* Lab 6 - Part 2

Lab 6 had blackjack for part 2, which was my favorite lab. Obviously it is not because of the gambling, but because of being able to code a small game which was fun. The output of the code was intriguing and enjoyable, which made it worthwhile.

* Lab 4 - Part 1

The conversions part of Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because of how applicable the code was to the next sets of TODOs. Once one part was finished, you could throw that code into the next chunk, and tweak it a little bit, and keep going down the line. It started to work and make sense and it was much easier than making different sets of code.

* Lab 7 

Lab 7 was interesting, difficult, and decently enjoyable. It was different from a lot of the labs, with each area having unique restrictions, and having to make sure that a set of restrictions was created for each unique situation. It was somewhat irritating to get the numbers and orders right, but apart from that, it was pretty enjoyable.
